To run this, start by installing Node.js 4.3.1 (https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once installed open up a shell and cd to this directory

Do the following:

1. Check node is installed by typing: 

>>node -v 

(you should see 4.3.1)

2. Next type:

>>npm install

(You should see a lot of output)

3. Once that is finished type:

>>npm start

(Output should be:
 > tutorial@0.0.0 start C:\Users\Liam\Desktop\tutorial
 > node ./bin/www)

4. open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/

You should see a very basic web page

Open app.js, routes.js and public/index.html and try and learn whats going on.
